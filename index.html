		<div class="explanation">
			<p>Occasionally, new software engineers are confused by me saying their design or code are “not good enough”, and their question/response is usually one of the these:</p>
			<p>“Not good enough” is a very vague term here. Usually I would use some less-vague-but-still-very-vague-terms such as “not simple enough”, “not easy to understand”, “not user friendly”, “not self-explainable”, etc. Usually I would have a chat with this engineer about why we need to design a simple architecture, why you should write simple, easy-to-understand code, why you should format your code, why you should put an extra space between these two symbols…</p>
			<p>If you have been in software industry for couple of years, or care enough to read some books about how to write good code and how to design good architectures, you probably will feel the same way. Those are basic concepts that should be grasped by every new software engineer, but unfortunately not everyone understands the necessity of those concepts.</p>
			<p>Not only do some new engineers don’t insist on highest standards on the quality of the design and code, some engineers who have been in the software industry for a while also have this problem. You can ask them to read Code Complete 2, Clean Code, Art of Unix Programming, and other 10 different programming books (you name them), some of them will improve their engineering quality, some still won’t.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h1>Software Engineer vs. Software Artist</h1>
			<p>Why not every software engineer producing high quality code and high quality design? Maybe some of them are inexperienced; maybe some of them don’t know how to generalize what they have already learned from those books and past experience; maybe some of them just want to finish their work and to them, being a software engineer is just a job. But fundamentally, it’s because they think they are software engineers, not software artists.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>More Than a Software Builder</h2>
			<p>Software artists can surely build software with highest standards. But being a software artist is more than just being an excellent software engineer who can write good code and design good architectures. Being an artist in software industry requires you to understand your customers and be a teacher and an influencer.</p>
